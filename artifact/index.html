        <p>The form of the wallet forces the user to reduce what they carry. Its small size makes it easy to carry. Not only does this make for a nice, compact wallet, but it makes you think about what you really need to carry with you on a daily basis. I've minimized the contents to the bare essentials because of my wallet's small size.</p>

          <li>Opening a door while carrying something large is nearly impossible</li>
          <li>Running out of toilet paper is a tragedy. Timing is everything</li>
          <li>TV remotes are very easy to lose, but very difficult to locate</li>
          <li>Touch screen keyboards are not an optimal solution. They lead to misspellings. Instead of focusing on autocorrect technology, there must be a better way</li>
          <li>Sunglass cases are often much larger than they need to be and sometimes cannot be used with different pairs of sunglasses</li>
          <li>Dusting one's living space is not an enjoyable experience</li>
