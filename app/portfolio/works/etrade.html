        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>E*Trade Financial is an online brokerage with millions of daily users. The platform provides users access to a plurality of financial instruments (stocks, options, bonds, etc.)</p>

        <p>I worked at E*Trade as an Experience Architect. Financial products in general are complex and E*Trade's product is no exception - trades a simple as buying a single option must prompt the user to make a multitude of decisions regarding the trade. Because user understanding of the different types of trades varies significantly, it is important to provide direction for those with less knowledge, while keeping explanations out of the way for those who know what they're doing. User research proved critical to designing effective interfaces, as did a thorough and disciplined UX process including mapping user flow and regular user testing. Outside of UX design and planning, there was an element of project management to my work at E*Trade - planning projects and regularly interfacing with tech and business to keep things on track.</p>
